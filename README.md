Original description from CPF (https://github.com/mashedkeyboard):
A set of imports used by other Wikipedia bots I've created. These probably won't be of much use to anyone else, but you're welcome to them in accordance with the license if you like!

Configuration Files expected in home directory:
  const localConfigFilename string = "config.yml"
  const globalConfigFilename string = "config-global.yml"
  const botPasswordFilename string = "botpassword"
  from:  config.go
